====================

Logo design for Citelligence

1. The favicon can only be made out of the letters `ci`, as anything else is just an unreadable blob.
2. The full resolution version is (a) made with soft lights above the word citelligence, but then it needs a background (otherwise you see white spots). (b) without the soft lights but with background to make the subtitle thinner, (c) with full font weight and no background
3. Sources are available in Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Acrobat PDF.
4. The logotype is available in TTF format and is provided under a Free license.
